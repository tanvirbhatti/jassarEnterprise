For larger areas, using a snow blower is highly efficient. It's also important to work systematically, starting from the entrance and moving outward. Maintaining a steady pace will help you avoid overexertion. After snow removal, applying ice melt is vital to prevent the formation of new ice and provide safer walking and driving surfaces."
